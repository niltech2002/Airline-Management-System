1. Workflow (How it works)

Here’s the flow you can explain step-by-step in the interview:

Login – The system starts with a login screen where the staff enters valid credentials stored in the database.

Home Dashboard – After logging in, the user sees a menu with all features like flight details, booking, cancellations, etc.

Add Customer – Staff can enter passenger details (name, nationality, gender, phone, etc.) which get stored in the database.

Flight Details – Displays a list of all available flights, fetched directly from the database.

Book Flight – Staff can search flights based on source and destination, fetch passenger details using Aadhaar number, and confirm booking, which generates a PNR and ticket number.

Journey Details – Allows checking a passenger’s travel details using the PNR number.

Cancel Ticket – Cancels an existing booking using the PNR and updates the database accordingly.

Boarding Pass – Generates a boarding pass with passenger and flight information for check-in.
